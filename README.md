## Instructions

Your task is to generate the following CSS classes: .container-1, .container-2, .container-3, .container-4.

You'll find a link to boilerplate files [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/scss_challenges/blob/25022f72a23b6930b01dbb62f218d468fc3f035a/challenge%202/challenge2.scss) to help get you started. There is a list of colors in the challenge2.scss file. Each of those classes should have one of the colors from the list set as a value for the background-color property. Use any of the loops you want!
